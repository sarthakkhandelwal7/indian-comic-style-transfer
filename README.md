# Indian Comic Style Transfer

> Fineâ€‘tuning Stableâ€¯Diffusion to generate images in the bold, vibrant style of 1980s Rajâ€¯Comicsâ€™ *Nagraj*.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project explores how to adapt a preâ€‘trained Stableâ€¯Diffusion model to the unique visual grammar of *Nagraj* comic panels. All detailsâ€”goals, approach, and evaluation metricsâ€”are experimental and may evolve as we gain insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals (Tentative)

* Experiment with LoRA adapters to capture Nagrajâ€™s highâ€‘contrast line art and flat colors.
* Generate photoâ€‘realistic inputs rendered as dynamic comic panels in Nagraj style.
* Build an endâ€‘toâ€‘end Colab/demo pipeline for easy inference and sharing.
* Evaluate style fidelity qualitatively; refine based on visual assessments.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Idea

Leverage unpaired style transfer: fineâ€‘tune Stableâ€¯Diffusion exclusively on cropped panels from the Rajâ€¯Comics *Nagraj* series. By anchoring with a common style prompt, we teach the model to apply bold outlines, vibrant fills, and dramatic compositions characteristic of these comics.

## ðŸ›  Approach (Initial Plan)

1. **Panel Extraction**: Use a Python/OpenCV script to crop rectangular panels from the PDF.
2. **Data Preparation**: Resize and centerâ€‘crop all panels to 512Ã—512 px; store in `data/style/`.
3. **Prompt Assignment**: Use one or a small set of styleâ€‘focused prompts to label each image.
4. **LoRA Fineâ€‘tuning**: Run the Huggingâ€¯Face Diffusers LoRA example on these panels.
5. **Inference & Review**: Generate test outputs in Colab; compare against original panels.
6. **Iteration**: Tweak prompts, hyperparameters, and dataset composition based on results.

> **Note**: All steps are subject to change as we learn what works best for this niche comic style.

## ðŸš§ Current State

* **Panel extraction script**

  * Renders the PDF to images
  * Crop comic panels
* **LoRA training recipe** 
  * Based on Huggingâ€¯Face Diffusers
